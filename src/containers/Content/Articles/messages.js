    defaultMessage: `Article published in Proceedings of WVC 2015 with the title
    "A Bipartite Graph Model Approach For Discriminant Features Evaluation". In this article, we propose a
    bipartite graph model able to evaluate how much a feature is discriminant, according to our metric
    based in graph topology. This article was produced using my scientific initiation research.
    It was presented in the Oral Session in SÃ£o Carlos, SP - Brazil.`,
